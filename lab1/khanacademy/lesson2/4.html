        <p class="Hello"><em><strong>Hawaii</strong></em> is an island state in the<strong> Western United States</strong>, about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland in the Pacific Ocean. It is the only <strong>U.S.</strong> state outside <strong>North America</strong>, the only one which is an archipelago, and the only one in the tropics.</p>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p class="Hello">The State of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, Hawaiʻi.<br>A common explanation of the name of Hawaiʻi is that it was named for Hawaiʻiloa, a figure from Hawaiian oral tradition.<br> He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.
